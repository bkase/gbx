Yes—design the transport so **all queue logic is identical** across WASM and native, and only the *atomics + memory view* change behind a tiny shim. Then the same `Port`/`Endpoint`/`WorkerRuntime`/`FabricBuilder` we sketched runs in browsers (SharedArrayBuffer + Worker) and in native (mmap/Vec<u8> + thread), while preserving your scheduler invariants and policy semantics (strictly non-blocking services; explicit `SubmitOutcome`; RR drains; A/V `Must` handling).  

Below is a practical blueprint with code-level interfaces and a concrete **linear-memory fabric** (header, directory, rings, mailboxes, doorbells, arenas).

---

# 1) One codebase, two ultra-thin backends

Make every queue operate on **byte offsets** into a shared linear buffer. The ring math stays in Rust; only atomic loads/stores and (worker-side) waits differ.

```rust
/// Minimal surface the rings need. Offsets are byte offsets from base.
pub trait AtomicMem {
  // 32-bit atomics (head/tail, doorbells, flags)
  unsafe fn load_i32(&self, off: u32, order: Ordering) -> i32;
  unsafe fn store_i32(&self, off: u32, val: i32, order: Ordering);
  unsafe fn fetch_add_i32(&self, off: u32, val: i32, order: Ordering) -> i32;

  // Worker-only parking (main thread never calls these in your model)
  fn wait_i32(&self, off: u32, expected: i32, timeout_ms: Option<f64>) -> WaitResult;
  fn notify_i32(&self, off: u32, count: u32) -> u32;

  // Raw view to copy payload bytes (rings are fixed-size records; bulk via arenas)
  unsafe fn copy_from(&self, dst_off: u32, src: *const u8, len: usize);
  unsafe fn copy_to(&self, src_off: u32, dst: *mut u8, len: usize);
}
```

Backends:

* **WASM (web)**: implement `AtomicMem` on top of **`SharedArrayBuffer`** views using `js_sys::Atomics::{load, store, add, wait, notify}` on an `Int32Array` plus a `Uint8Array` for byte copies. Use it in **Workers** (where `Atomics.wait` is allowed). The main-thread adapter never calls `wait`.
* **Native**: implement `AtomicMem` over a `*mut u8` base (from `mmap`, `memfd`, or `Vec<u8>`) using `std::sync::atomic::AtomicI32` at the computed addresses, and `ptr::copy_*` for bytes. For parking in the worker thread, either busy-wait with backoff or add an optional per-ring futex/condvar doorbell (your main thread still never blocks).

Everything above the shim—rings, mailboxes, endpoint routing, multiplexing, sharding—stays 100% identical across platforms. That preserves your trait contract (services are strictly non-blocking; they return `WouldBlock` instead of waiting) and the scheduler logic (count-based budgets, explicit outcomes, RR drains).

# 2) The Fabric: mapping endpoints onto one linear memory

Think of the **Fabric** as a self-describing “disk image” for runtime transport:

```
+-------------------------------+ 0
| FABRIC HEADER                 |
|  - magic/version/size         |
|  - counts: endpoints, regions |
|  - offsets to tables          |
+-------------------------------+
| ENDPOINT TABLE [N]            |  ← one row per service endpoint
|  - cmd_lossless : RegionId    |
|  - cmd_besteff : RegionId     |
|  - cmd_mailbox  : RegionId    |
|  - reps         : RegionId    |
|  - doorbells    : RegionId    |
|  - metrics      : RegionId    |
+-------------------------------+
| REGION DIRECTORY [M]          |  ← kind, flags, offset, length, align
+-------------------------------+
| RING/MAILBOX HEADERS & DATA   |  ← multiple regions: fixed-size slots
+-------------------------------+
| ARENAS (bump / slot-pool)     |  ← variable-size bulk payloads
+-------------------------------+
| METRICS / TRACE BUFFERS       |
+-------------------------------+ size
```

### Region kinds

* `Ring { head, tail, rec_sz, cap, data_off }` – classic power-of-two SPSC.
* `Mailbox { seq, state, cell_off, cell_sz }` – single “latest” message cell (coalescing).
* `Doorbells { main_to_worker, worker_to_main }` – `AtomicI32` slots for wakeups.
* `ArenaBump { base, len, epoch }` – frame/epoch-scoped bump allocator.
* `ArenaSlots { header, freelist, heap }` – zero-copy **slot pool** (fixed chunk size) for bulk attachments.
* `Metrics { counters… }` – per-endpoint depths, outcomes, drops.

Each region is addressed by a **byte offset**. The `Endpoint` given to a service adapter is just a bundle of *region IDs*; the ring/mailbox code resolves IDs to offsets via the directory and calls into the `AtomicMem` backend.

---

# 3) Sizing & policy → ports

From your defaults and A/V rules:

* **Policy table**: Display-lane GPU uploads are `Must`; thumbnails `BestEffort`; audio submits `Must`. FS autosave `Coalesce`, manual `Lossless`.  
* **Scheduler rules**: `(Lossless, WouldBlock)` → requeue to P0-front; services never block; one shared RR drain budget.  
* **Suggested ring sizes** (a good starting point): Cmd 32 KB, Events 512 KB, Frame bulk 256 KB–2 MB, Audio 128 KB. 

The FabricBuilder uses each service’s `ServiceDescriptor::port_spec()` to allocate:

```rust
enum RegionKind { Ring, Mailbox, Doorbells, ArenaBump, ArenaSlots, Metrics }

struct PortSpec {
  lossless_cmd: Option<RingSpec>,      // e.g., 32 KB, rec_sz=64
  besteff_cmd: Option<RingSpec>,       // 16 KB, rec_sz=64
  coalesce_cmd: Option<MailboxSpec>,   // rec_sz=64
  reps: RingSpec,                      // 512 KB, rec_sz=64..128
  bulk: Vec<RegionKind>,               // e.g., ArenaSlots(Frame), ArenaSlots(Audio)
}
```

> **Why several rings?** Splitting by policy (lossless vs coalesce vs best-effort) mechanizes the semantics *in the transport* so your `Service` just returns the correct `SubmitOutcome` (`Accepted`, `Coalesced`, `Dropped`, `WouldBlock`) and remains non-blocking. The scheduler already interprets those outcomes. 

---

# 4) Arenas inside the fabric (when & how)

You’ll want **two complementary arenas**, both living inside the same linear memory:

## 4.1 Epoch bump arena (scratch, frame-scoped)

Great for **transient** worker scratch that doesn’t cross the boundary (e.g., decode scratch, temporary staging). It’s a single pointer:

```
struct Bump {
  cur: AtomicU32,  // byte offset within region
  end: u32,
  epoch: AtomicU32 // monotonic; bump can be reset when epoch changes
}
```

* Worker allocs with `fetch_add`; no frees.
* Reset policy: bump `epoch` at safe boundaries (e.g., after publishing `TickDone` or once the main has consumed a frame ID). This matches your frame cadence and avoids fragmentation.

**Use when:** the data won’t be referenced by the other side after the frame/epoch (no descriptor crossing the ring).

## 4.2 Slot-pool arena (zero-copy cross-boundary payloads)

This is the cross-thread, *stable* storage. You already leaned this way with `SlotPool`/`MsgRing` in the native tests; keep it in the fabric so both WASM and native share the same semantics. Each allocation returns a **`SlotSpan { slot_idx, gen, offset, len }`**:

* **Fixed-size slots** (e.g., 64 KiB for frames, 4 KiB for audio).
* **Free list** managed with atomic LIFO.
* **Generation counter** per slot to detect stale descriptors (ABA guard).
* `Span` gets *passed by value* in the command/reply rings; the receiver uses the span to read bytes directly in place.

**Use when:** you want **zero-copy** payload transfer (frames/audio) or potentially **recycle** buffers across the boundary without copying.

> Pattern: Worker writes into a free `FrameSlot`, emits `KernelRep::LaneFrame{ span }`; the main-thread GPU service reads directly from that span, then returns the slot to the pool. This preserves your “must show display frame in the same tick” requirement while keeping the command ring tiny. 

---

# 5) The queues (unchanged) over the fabric

Rings are index-math plus atomics—identical in WASM/native thanks to `AtomicMem`:

```rust
pub struct Ring<'a, M: AtomicMem> {
  mem: &'a M,      // backend
  head_off: u32,   // AtomicI32
  tail_off: u32,   // AtomicI32
  mask: u32,       // cap-1
  rec_sz: u32,
  data_off: u32,
}

impl<M: AtomicMem> Ring<'_, M> {
  pub fn try_push(&self, rec: &[u8]) -> Result<(), RingFull> {
    let tail = unsafe { self.mem.load_i32(self.tail_off, Acquire) as u32 };
    let head = unsafe { self.mem.load_i32(self.head_off, Acquire) as u32 };
    if (tail - head) & self.mask == self.mask { return Err(RingFull); } // full

    let idx = tail & self.mask;
    let dst = self.data_off + idx * self.rec_sz;
    unsafe { self.mem.copy_from(dst, rec.as_ptr(), self.rec_sz as usize); }
    unsafe { self.mem.store_i32(self.tail_off, (tail.wrapping_add(1)) as i32, Release); }

    // optional: ring doorbell
    Ok(())
  }

  pub fn try_pop(&self, out: &mut [u8]) -> Option<()> {
    let head = unsafe { self.mem.load_i32(self.head_off, Acquire) as u32 };
    let tail = unsafe { self.mem.load_i32(self.tail_off, Acquire) as u32 };
    if head == tail { return None; }

    let idx = head & self.mask;
    let src = self.data_off + idx * self.rec_sz;
    unsafe { self.mem.copy_to(src, out.as_mut_ptr(), self.rec_sz as usize); }
    unsafe { self.mem.store_i32(self.head_off, (head.wrapping_add(1)) as i32, Release); }
    Some(())
  }
}
```

A **Mailbox<T>** is the same idea with a single record and a `seq`/`valid` word; `write()` returns `Accepted` or `Coalesced`.

Your **`Service` adapters** just *route by policy* to `lossless`, `besteffort`, or `mailbox` ports and return `SubmitOutcome` straight from those ports; `drain(max)` pulls from the `reps` port. That’s exactly your trait’s contract and the scheduler’s expectation. 

---

# 6) Multi-service / multi-worker mapping (in one fabric)

* **One Worker ↔ Many Services**: give each service its own `Endpoint` group (own rings/mailbox/reps/metrics) inside the same buffer. The worker runtime holds an engine per endpoint and **round-robins** them. No head-of-line blocking because ports are disjoint.
* **One Service ↔ Many Workers (shards)**: the main-side adapter owns **N endpoints** (one per worker). `try_submit` hashes `Cmd` to choose the shard (e.g., by `group`), preserving per-group order; `drain(max)` performs a small **k-way RR merge** over N reply rings. (If you ever need *global* order, compare a `stamp` in the fixed header and do an ordered merge.)
* **Pipelines** (Decode→Postprocess→Encode): place private internal rings between engines inside the *same* worker; only surface the outer Endpoint to the main thread.

All of these keep SPSC purity and the main thread non-blocking.

---

# 7) Handshake & lifecycle

* **Bootstrap**: the main builds a `FabricLayout` ⇒ allocates one SAB (web) or mmap/Vec (native) ⇒ fills header + directory ⇒ spawns Worker(s), passing the buffer and a list of endpoint IDs they own.
* **Versioning**: header includes `magic`, `abi_version`, and feature bits. On mismatch, Worker sets `Closed`; the main sees `Closed` outcomes and triggers your **restart/re-sync** flow (spawn new worker, reissue `LoadRom`/`SetInputs`, etc.). 
* **Health**: per-endpoint metrics region tracks queue depths and outcome counters; the scheduler reads those to drive `gpu_blocked`, `service_pressure`, etc., as you specified. 

---

# 8) When to use the arena (practical recipes)

* **Display frame**: Worker fills a `FrameSlot` from the **slot-pool arena**, emits `KernelRep::LaneFrame{ span, frame_id }`. Main’s GPU service reads directly from `span` and returns the slot after `FrameShown`. (Display is `Must`; thumbnails are `BestEffort` and can share a smaller slot pool.) 
* **Audio**: same pattern with a smaller slot size (e.g., 4 KiB chunks). If the GPU is congested, your scheduler’s mitigation window drops thumbnails but preserves audio/display `Must`. 
* **FS autosave**: the **mailbox** coalesces the newest autosave request, and the payload is a `SlotSpan` into a **documents slot pool**—the worker owns write; the FS worker reads and frees on completion. (Manual saves use the lossless ring.) 

---

# 9) Why this satisfies your goals

* **Same code in WASM & native**: all queue/endpoint/runtime logic is shared; only `AtomicMem` differs.
* **Policy-first guarantees**: encoded by which port a `Cmd` uses; outcomes map directly to your scheduler rules (no implicit waiting).  
* **Zero-copy where it matters**: arenas (slot pool) carry bulk; rings carry tiny descriptors; everything is single-pass and cache-friendly.
* **Topology freedom**: one worker ↔ many services; many workers ↔ one service; pipelines—without ever switching to slow MPMC queues.

---

# 10) Minimal implementation checklist

1. **Backends**: `transport_fabric::mem::web_sab` and `transport_fabric::mem::native` implementing `AtomicMem`.
2. **Regions**: header + directory structs (POD; fixed endianness), builders, and verifiers.
3. **Ports**: `LosslessRing`, `BestEffortRing`, `Mailbox` parametrized by `AtomicMem`.
4. **Endpoint**: typed bundle `{lossless, besteffort, mailbox, reps}` with a small `PortSpec`.
5. **Service adapters**: thin `{ try_submit, drain }` that route by `default_policy()` (no overrides). 
6. **WorkerRuntime**: RR loop over engines; global + per-endpoint doorbells.
7. **Arenas**: `SlotPool` (zero-copy spans) + `BumpArena` (epoch-scoped scratch).
8. **Metrics**: counters in a region; surfaced to the scheduler for `gpu_blocked/service_pressure` logic. 

If you’d like, I can draft the `AtomicMem` trait with the two concrete backends and the `RegionDirectory`/`EndpointTable` structs so you can drop them into `crates/transport-fabric/` and immediately back your current Kernel/GPU/Audio services with the same code in web and native.
